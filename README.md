# 👋 Hi, I'm Diego Bastidas

I'm a **Software Engineer** with a strong background in **Backend Development**, particularly with **Symfony and PHP**. Over time, I've expanded my expertise into the world of **DevOps**, where I focus on automation, scalability, and efficient delivery workflows.

My journey has led me to work with tools like **Docker**, **Kubernetes** (using **Amazon EKS** and **eksctl**), and cloud platforms like **AWS**. I build and maintain **CI/CD pipelines** using **GitHub Actions** and **Jenkins**, and I use **Bash scripting** to automate and optimize development and deployment processes.

I enjoy bridging the gap between development and operations, aiming to deliver clean, maintainable code and reliable infrastructure.
